A project developed during high school days around 2014/2015. Sadly, it is no longer developed and it just sits here for nostalgia purposes and possible piece of my portfolio.

It's made in C++ using mainly SFML and Lua scripts for easy customizability and support of modding by third parties.
Some/most of the graphics is hand drawn.
