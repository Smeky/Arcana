# Arcana

The second game I worked on and the largest personal project so far. The game is based on Rogue-like RPG genre and has been developed for over 7 months during my high school days.

Game was written in C++ and Lua. The decision behing porting a lot of functionality to Lua was to fully support game modifications by third parties (aka modding).
